## Final Project For Regression Models
# Course 7 of JHU Data Science Sequence

This was my final project for Regression Models, the 7th course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science specialization on Coursera. Project requirements were to analyse the mtcars data set using am (transmission) to predict mpg (miles per gallon).

Project was to be completed using markdown and put into pdf form with Knitr. This repo contains the [original Rmd file](https://github.com/lgallen/regressionmodels/blob/master/transvsmpg.Rmd) as well as the [completed pdf](https://github.com/lgallen/regressionmodels/blob/master/transvsmpg.pdf).
